## Structure
The folder **formationCLIENT** contains the source code of the Angular application.

The folder **formationREST** contains the source code of the Symfony application (as a RESTful API).

These two applications can be deployed into two different servers, just edit the config files if needed.

## Get started

### First step
- Clone the project (or fork it if you want to contribute : [How to contribute](https://github.com/ETICINSATechnologies/Plateforme-Formation/blob/master/HowToContribute.md))

### Frontend
- Install [Node.js with npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if not done.
- Install *angular-cli* globally
```
$ npm install -g @angular/cli
```
- Open a terminale in the folder **formationCLIENT**
- Install all frontend packages with npm :
```
$ npm install
```
- Serve the application
```
$ ng serve --open
```
It will launch the server, watch your files, and rebuild the app as you make changes to those files.
